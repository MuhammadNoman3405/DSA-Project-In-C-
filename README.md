# ✈️ Travel Management System (DSA Implementation)

A specialized C++ application developed to manage flight reservations using high-performance **Doubly Linked List** data structures. This project focuses on efficient memory management and bidirectional data traversal.

---

## 📊 Technical Architecture

This project implements a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** rather than a standard array or singly linked list. 

**Why DLL?**
- **Bidirectional Navigation**: Each node contains `next` and `prev` pointers.
- **Efficient Deletion**: Re-routes pointers without shifting data ($O(1)$ complexity).
- **Dynamic Growth**: Memory is allocated on the heap only when needed.
